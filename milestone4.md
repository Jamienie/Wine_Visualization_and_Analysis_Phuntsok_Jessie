# Milestone 4 
<br>

## What changes did you decide to implement given the time limit, and why do you think this is the best thing to focus on?

- We implement a summary tab to introduce users how to use our app and what information they can gain from the graph. In addition, we reference our public and personal repository links. 

- We change two plots' positions (price distribution and points distribution). Before, two plots are displayed vertically, so that users have to scroll up and down to visualize all three plots. Therefore, we displayed these two plots horizontally for better visualization. 

- We fill the histograms by different colors to make them look nicer. 

- We change app's theme using package 'shinytheme'. 

- We better document on app's code. 

We believe these are the best changes to implement as we can do all of the changes efficiently and quickly within the time limit. 

## If you were to make the app again from scratch (or some other app in general), what would you do differently?

We would make better use of features in data set. In the data set, there are reviews of testers for each different wines. We would use Word Cloud to provide a user with insight into word use within reviews. By emulating testers' review, users can gain more information about different varieties and are able to find their desired wines more exactly. 
Additionally, we would be more deliberate to choose types of graphs and had decisions earlier. We went back and forth to decide what kinds of plot to present the data, though we already have our objectives at the early stage.  

## What were the greatest challenges you faced in creating the final product?
