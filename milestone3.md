Reflections on Feedback Received
===============================

Summary of feedbacks we received from our peers:
-------------------------------------------------------------
-Changing the titles of the plots 
-Perhaps fliping the “variety” and “points” axis on one of the plots
- moving the label further on one of the plots to the right to improve readability.
-One good point is that the plot is ordered
-The second plot’s legend does not fit.
-The details that pop-up on hover are really helpful.
-Minor bugs when filters are left empty or dataset is empty with set filters. Look into req() shiny function to stop application from throwing an error with missing input.
-The sub filters disappearing as you change parent filters. It would be nice if these could stay on by default.
-Color variable is mapped to the same variable that is on the x axis for your scatter plots. This is a bit redundant. You could instead map color to wine type or to points when x is price etc.
-Continuing  developing your summary and table tabs.


Actions taken on the feedback:
-------------------------------------
- Some of our peers pointed out that some of our graphs were redundant. So we talked to the lecture instructor Cydney, lab instructor Vincenzo and out teaching assistant Sahir, and all of them recommended getting rid of the scatter plots and  adding a violin plot and histogram.
- Our first graph had bugs in them and also the legend was redundant, so removing it would take care of the issue
- We also made an improvement on our filters so that the subfilters don't disappear when you change your parent filters.
- we created a violin plot to show the price and points distribution of wine and also created two histograms.
- Last time, our data tab was empty, and this time we have added the wine data under the data tab.

    
Vision & Next Steps:
------------------------
Our goal for the next milestone is to improve our app even further.
