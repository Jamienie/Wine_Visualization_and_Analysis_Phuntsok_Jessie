Reflections on Feedback Received
===============================

Summary of feedbacks we received from out peers:
-------------------------------------------------------------
-Changing the titles of the plots 
-Perhaps fliping the “variety” and “points” axis on one of the plots
- moving the label further on one of the plots to the right to improve readability.
-One good point is that the plot is ordered
-The second plot’s legend does not fit.
-The details that pop-up on hover are really helpful.
-Minor bugs when filters are left empty or dataset is empty with set filters. Look into req() shiny function to stop application from throwing an error with missing input.
-The sub filters disappearing as you change parent filters. It would be nice if these could stay on by default.
-Color variable is mapped to the same variable that is on the x axis for your scatter plots. This is a bit redundant. You could instead map color to wine type or to points when x is price etc.
-Continuing  developing your summary and table tabs.


Actions taken on the feedback:
-------------------------------------
- Some of our peers pointed out that some of our graphs were redundant. So we talked to the lecture instructor Cydney, lab instructor Vincenzo and out teaching assistant Sahir, and all of them recommended getting rid of two of our three graphs by combining the three graphs into one graph and also adding a violin plot.
- Our first graph had bugs in them and also the legend was redundant, so removing it would take care of the issue
- We also made an improvement on our filters so that the subfilters don't disappear when you change your parent filters.
- Combining 3 graphs into 1, would also take care of the color redundancy in our scatterplot.
- Last time, our data tabs and our summary tabs were empty, and this time we will be adding a short summary of our app under the summary tab, and also include the wine data table under the data tab.

    
Vision & Next Steps:
------------------------
Our goal for the next milestone is to improve our app even further.
